# sample.BYOJackson
Sample application and blog post describing how to package Jackson with your Liberty application.

This repo includes a sample application showing how a WebSphere Liberty user could add their own
Jackson binaries to their Java EE application so that they can use Jackson APIs for serializing/deserializing JSON objects
with JAX-RS.

This sample is referenced from a WASdev article archived [here](BYOJackson-article.md).
